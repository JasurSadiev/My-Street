Information for Citizens
What is My Street?
My Street is an independent platform where citizens can report issues in their communities directly to the responsible local authorities. This transparency enables better tracking and resolution of public issues.

Is this a council website?
No, it isn't. However, My Street forwards reports directly to your local council or the authority responsible for addressing the issue. Reports are also published online so the community can stay informed and engage.

Then who are you? And why are you doing this?
Our goal is to simplify the process of reporting issues within communities, making it accessible even if you don’t know the exact responsible authority. With My Street, simply enter your location, describe the issue, and we’ll handle the rest.

How can I contact you?
Feel free to reach out via our contact form. But before that, please take a moment to see if these FAQs answer your question.
